# RNP (Rust NumPy)
### An end to end ipmlementation of NumPy in Rust starting from scratch.

### This is a basic implementation of NumPy in Rust that I have implemented as a side project. Right now it contains the basic array operations such as addition, subtraction and dot product.

Just run the `main.rs` file independently for now; I will create a whole crate for it shortly.


first error that I made: never use ';' when returning a generic :`)
